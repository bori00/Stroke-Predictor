        "Since the model that we build acts as a binary classifier, it it only natural that we rely on the confusion matrix to evaluate our model. \n",

        "However, we should decide which confusion-matrix-related metrics is most important for us: **do we care more about precision, i.e. making sure that all people said to have had a stroke by the model indeed had a stroke, or recall, i.e. maximizing the probability that a person who had a stroke is detected by the model as such?** Or maybe should we take both into account, in form of a more complex metrics? It is likely that at some point we'll need to make a compromise, due to the precision-recall tradeoff concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of medical analysis, the first intuition may be that the recall should have a higher weight in deciding which model fits best. In general, when it comes to detecting such mortal diseases, **the cost of not detecting someone's tendency to get the disease is likely death**. We generally consider the death of a human being to be a far higher cost compared to the financial costs related to unnecessary medical analysis and preventive treatment. \n",

        "There's one mistake in the above train of thought though: note that the goal of our analysis is not that of deciding whether someone needs treatment, surgery, medicines or any other measue to avoid a stroke when they are already close to getting it, rather that of getting an insight into lifestyle choices that may influence one's tendency to get a stroke. In this context, we want to give the readers a picture as accurate as possible. \n",

        "*   *if we considered recall only*, the opposite may happen, some factors leading to stroke are likely to be overestimated, causing the people to take otherwise painful decisions in order to avoid a stroke (such as changing a job, restricting themselves a healthier, but less enjoyable diet, ...)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Thus, we should use a metric that combines recall and precision. Such a metric is the F2-score, the harmonic mean of recall and precision.**\n",

        "Additionally, it may help us to compare models or to find the best hyperparameters for each model to take a look at the **Precision/Recall-curve**. \n",
        "\n",
        "We may take into account the ROC curve as well, but it was shown that it is not a good indicator in case the input dataset is highly unbalanced. As we only have 5% of the entries with a positive 'stroke' label, we should stick to the Precision/Recall-curve instead."
