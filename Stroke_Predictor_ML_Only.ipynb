It is likely that at some point we'll need to make a compromise, due to the precision-recall tradeoff concept.\n",

In general, when it comes to detecting such mortal diseases, **the cost of not detecting someone's tendency to get the disease is likely death**. We generally consider the death of a human being to be a far higher cost compared to the financial costs related to unnecessary medical analysis and preventive treatment. \n",

In this context, we want to give the readers a picture as accurate as possible. \n",

        "Before taking the next steps, we should think about why the LogisticRegression performed so badly. To answer this question, we should dive deeper into the working mechanism of the logistic regression models: they estimate the probability of an entry belonging to a certain class by applying the sigmoid function to a weighted linear combination of the features. **The key here is that it cannot actually learn non-linear relationships between the features and the label.** Knowing that we didn't have any feature in our dataset, which would have been highly correlated (thus showing a strong linear relationship with our label) with the label, it is in fact not surprising that a logistic regression cannot perform well. \n",
