        "Since the model that we build acts as a binary classifier, it it only natural that we rely on the confusion matrix to evaluate our model. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, we should decide which confusion-matrix-related metrics is most important for us: **do we care more about precision, i.e. making sure that all people said to have had a stroke by the model indeed had a stroke, or recall, i.e. maximizing the probability that a person who had a stroke is detected by the model as such?** Or maybe should we take both into account, in form of a more complex metrics? It is likely that at some point we'll need to make a compromise, due to the precision-recall tradeoff concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of medical analysis, the first intuition may be that the recall should have a higher weight in deciding which model fits best. In general, when it comes to detecting such mortal diseases, **the cost of not detecting someone's tendency to get the disease is likely death**. We generally consider the death of a human being to be a far higher cost compared to the financial costs related to unnecessary medical analysis and preventive treatment. \n",
        "\n",
        "There's one mistake in the above train of thought though: note that the goal of our analysis is not that of deciding whether someone needs treatment, surgery, medicines or any other measue to avoid a stroke when they are already close to getting it, rather that of getting an insight into lifestyle choices that may influence one's tendency to get a stroke. In this context, we want to give the readers a picture as accurate as possible. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   *if we focused on precision only*, probably some factors leading to a stroke may be underestimated, causing the readers taking lifestyle choices based on our analysis to be overconfident in the healthiness of their lifestyle\n",
        "*   *if we considered recall only*, the opposite may happen, some factors leading to stroke are likely to be overestimated, causing the people to take otherwise painful decisions in order to avoid a stroke (such as changing a job, restricting themselves a healthier, but less enjoyable diet, ...)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Thus, we should use a metric that combines recall and precision. Such a metric is the F1-score, the harmonic mean of recall and precision.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, it may help us to compare models or to find the best hyperparameters for each model to take a look at the **Precision/Recall-curve**. \n",
        "\n",
        "We may take into account the ROC curve as well, but it was shown that it is not a good indicator in case the input dataset is highly unbalanced. As we only have 5% of the entries with a positive 'stroke' label, we should stick to the Precision/Recall-curve instead."

        "Before taking the next steps, we should think about why the LogisticRegression performed so badly. To answer this question, we should dive deeper into the working mechanism of the logistic regression models: they estimate the probability of an entry belonging to a certain class by applying the sigmoid function to a weighted linear combination of the features. **The key here is that it cannot actually learn non-linear relationships between the features and the label.** Knowing that we didn't have any feature in our dataset, which would have been highly correlated (thus showing a strong linear relationship with our label) with the label, it is in fact not surprising that a logistic regression cannot perform well. \n",
