        "Before taking the next steps, we should think about why the LogisticRegression performed so badly. To answer this question, we should dive deeper into the working mechanism of the logistic regression models: they estimate the probability of an entry belonging to a certain class by applying the sigmoid function to a weighted linear combination of the features. **The key here is that it cannot actually learn non-linear relationships between the features and the label.** Knowing that we didn't have any feature in our dataset, which would have been highly correlated (thus showing a strong linear relationship with our label) with the label, it is in fact not surprising that a logistic regression cannot perform well. \n",
